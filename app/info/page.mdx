# Shipwrecked

Shipwrecked is a once-in-a-lifetime, four-day flagship hackathon on Cathleen Stone Island in the Boston Harbor that is organized by Hack Club, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that supports a global community of over 50,000 high school makers.

## What is Shipwrecked?

On **August 8-11**, you and 130 other hackers will gather on **Cathleen Stone Island in the Boston Harbor** for a once in a lifetime, **4-day story-based hackathon**!

As soon as you get there, you'll all start working together to survive on the island you've been stranded on.

Once we're on the island, everyone will work in smaller groups and complete quests. These will be centered around interacting with the world around you: helping the villagers develop software or hardware projects that help them sell their produce, helping the pirates plan their routes more effectively, or building projects to help your fellow shipwreck-mates organize your efforts more effectively. _(Not literally, of course... there's no pirates or villagers in the Boston Harbor. This is similar to Dungeons & Dragons!)_

# The Bay

Through **The Bay**, you'll earn an invitation to Shipwrecked. In The Bay you will spend 60 hours making projects with the goal of making them **go viral**.

Going viral means making a really polished project you are extremely proud of, which you then promote to get other people to check it out! You can find the criteria for virality [here](/info/go-viral). Once you reach 60 hours & one of your projects has gone viral, you'll receive an invitation to Shipwrecked!

## The Pier

Every week, you can meet up with your friends either in person or over [The Pier](https://pier.hackclub.com) - our video game-like digital meeting space to work! You are welcome — and encouraged — to team up with a friend to make a project! Just note that if you are working in a group, you all must log 60 hours respectively on [Hackatime](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/) towards your project.
